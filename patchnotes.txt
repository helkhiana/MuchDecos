Fixed:
- Item placement flickering and sometimes failing to place
- General changes and fixes to bring code in line with my other mods

Removed:
- Padlock
- Haybale
- Crafting Book
- Grave making
- Grave shovel
- Ability to use Padlock on openable items
- Power Transformer (it was too buggy and abusable)

Changed:
- Removed craftbench crafting and made them regular recipes
- Scarecrow recipe is combine clothing item with 1 firewood
- Barbed wire fence kit recipe is combine barbed wire and metal wire
Note: Workbench (Craftbench) still has the slots to store resources, just can't use it to craft anything
